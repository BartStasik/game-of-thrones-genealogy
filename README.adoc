== Setup

* Install Git
* Install Maven
* `(Optional)` Configure IDE to run with Maven

=== Maven on Windows

* Download `Binary zip archive`
* Unpack into a directory, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.6.0`
* Add `bin` folder into PATH

== Compiling and Building

To compile the Java source code, go to `got-genealogy` and run:
[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

Currently, there are no modules, so building is done by:

[source, shell]
----
mvn exec:java
----

== Debugging

To use with a debugger, you have to build the code with `mvnDebug` and connect to it remotely (default port: `8000`) from your IDE:

[source, shell]
----
mvnDebug exec:java
----

Compile and build shorthand:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install && mvnDebug exec:java
----
