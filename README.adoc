== Compiling and Building

To compile the Java source code, go to `got-genealogy` and run:
[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install
----

Currently, there are no modules, so building is done by:

[source, shell]
----
mvn exec:java
----

== Debugging

To use with a debugger, you have to build the code with `mvnDebug` and connect to remotely (default port: `8000`) from your IDE:

[source, shell]
----
mvnDebug exec:java
----

Compile and build shorthand:

[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install && mvnDebug exec:java
